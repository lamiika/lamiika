## Hi there 👋

I'm a student working on electronics and embedded systems.

Electronics projects:
* [lidar to arduino adapter](https://github.com/wawa2024/Design_of_Microcontroller_Controlled_Devices)
  - it has a system in package version and a from components version with the following diy modules: buck-boost converter, PWM generator, linear regulator and logic level converter

Embedded systems projects:
